# Google-Foobar
My solutions to the google foobar challenge. I don't know the questions as I forgot to save them. These are just the answers to 6 questions I was able to solve. I will try to remember and add the questions.

# Castle - The foobar clone
An open source implementaion of the Google Foobar challenge is currently being developed. Those who couldn't get an invitation to try the actual challenge can check it out at [Castle](https://github.com/akhilerm/Castle). The interface, questions and everything has been modeled to give you near to original foobar experience.

## DO NOT USE THESE SOLUTIONS FOR THE CHALLENGE. TRY AND MAKE YOUR OWN SOLUTIONS. WHILE YOU ARE DONE, YOU CAN JUST CHECK HOW EVERYBODY HAS DONE.
